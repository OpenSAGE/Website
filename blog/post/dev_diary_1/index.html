<p>This is the first in what I hope will be a continuing series of updates on <a href="https://github.com/OpenSAGE/OpenSAGE">OpenSAGE</a>, my C&amp;C Generals re-implementation project.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been working on OpenSAGE for about 6 months now. I&#39;m still working on parsing and rendering the basic data files (3D models, maps, etc.). There isn&#39;t yet any playable executable. Instead, there&#39;s a &quot;Data Viewer&quot; application, which lists all the files found in the Generals (or Zero Hour) installation folder, and lets you view these files. I&#39;ve found this approach helpful while writing parsers for the various file formats found in Generals. At some point, I&#39;ll transition to working on gameplay, and start to build up a playable executable.</p>
<p>Here is what the data viewer looks like. Here I&#39;m viewing the USA Command Center 3D model:</p>

<p>I meant to start writing about this project soon after I started it, but clearly that didn&#39;t happen. Instead of trying to list everything I&#39;ve done in the last 6 months, I&#39;ll just start from a week ago, and then try to keep up-to-date from now.</p>

          <h2>
            <a name="progress-this-week" href="#progress-this-week">
            Progress this week
            </a>
          </h2><p>This week, I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switched from a D3D12 renderer to a D3D11 renderer. I started out with a Direct3D 12 renderer because I wanted to learn Direct3D 12. Having done that, I realise it&#39;s not sensible for this particular project to require an API that only works on Windows 10. Direct3D 11 works on Windows 7 and above, and since many people are still on Windows 7, that&#39;s a better minimum requirement. I plan to add a Metal renderer (for macOS and iOS), and possibly Vulkan (for Android), depending on how popular this project is.</li>
<li>In order to render the terrain and 3D meshes, I was previously relying on a D3D12-only feature called dynamic texture indexing. This allowed me, for example when rendering a map, to put all the terrain textures in a big array and send that to the GPU, and the pixel shader could dynamically index the right texture. Dynamic texture indexing of an array of textures (i.e. <code>Texture2D[]</code>) isn&#39;t supported in D3D11, so I instead used D3D11&#39;s closest equivalent, a texture array (<code>Texture2DArray</code>).</li>
<li><code>Texture2DArray</code> requires all the textures in the array to have the same size and format (unlike <code>Texture2D[]</code>, where textures can have arbitrary sizes and formats). The terrain textures used in Generals maps are not all the same size. There are 4 possible sizes: 64x64, 128x128, 256x256, and 384x384. In order to put all these into a <code>Texture2DArray</code>, I had to upsample the smaller textures to 384x384. Not a perfect solution, but it was the least bad option I could think of, while keeping the nice ability to render an entire terrain patch with a single draw call.</li>
<li>Added a friendlier resource binding API. Previously, to set shader resources, I had to hard-code the resource slot in my C# code. Now I can use the name of the resource, as declared in HLSL, and using shader reflection I can match this to the resource slot.</li>
<li>Added a stub for a Bink video parser. Currently I can parse the container format, but not yet any of the video or audio packets. Cinematic videos in Generals use the Bink video format (stored in <code>.bik</code> files), and up to now I&#39;ve had a prototype Bink viewer that uses <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a> to play them. I&#39;m toying with the possibility of implementing a Bink parser and renderer completely in C#, to remove the FFmpeg dependency. Native dependencies cause all sorts of headaches for cross-platform deployments, so I&#39;d like to avoid them if I can. That said, Bink is not a simple format, so it might turn out to be a bad idea to try to implement it myself.</li>
<li>Fixed some memory leaks. I noticed, when shutting down the data viewer app, that Direct3D complained in the Visual Studio output window about unreleased live resources. I tracked these down to a place where I&#39;d forgotten to dispose some D3D objects.</li>
<li>Abstracted the material system to support shader materials. 3D models in Generals and Zero Hour all use vertex materials, which were built on D3D8&#39;s fixed-function pipeline. Later SAGE games (Battle for Middle-earth II, C&amp;C3, RA3) use shaders. I wanted to support both types of rendering early on, so that I don&#39;t need to do lots of refactoring later. Model rendering can now use either <code>FixedFunctionMaterial</code> (which still uses shaders, but it emulates a Generals-era fixed-function pipeline) or <code>ShaderMaterial</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, lots of refactoring and internal changes this week.</p>
<p>Next week I plan to work on the GUI. I have a prototype GUI renderer, built on WPF. I plan to rip this out and build a new one based on lower-level drawing APIs (Direct2D on Windows, and later, <code>CGContext</code> on macOS and iOS). Stay tuned!</p>
<p>Although I haven&#39;t done any work on maps this week, allow me to finish with a screenshot showing the current state of map rendering:</p>
