As you've probably noticed from reading this, we now have a website. The goal is to gather information about the project in a more end user friendly format & style than the [GitHub page](https://github.com/OpenSAGE/OpenSAGE), and to have a place where we can publish (hopefully!) regular development updates about the project. Previous blog posts about OpenSAGE were published on [Tim's blog](http://timjones.io/), and they have been imported to this blog too - you can find them from [the archive](/blog).

This website came to be when we decided we want to do a "A year in review" -style blog post about the things we've built this past year. I voluntereed to write that post, but I couldn't decide where I'd want to publish it. One thing lead to another, and as a typical example of yak shaving I ultimately ended up creating a new website for the entire project (and that blog post LINK HERE).

## About the implementation

The site is not the most complex thing I've ever written. From the visitor point of view it's a static website hosted on GitHub Pages consisting of just plain old HTML and CSS, but with progressive enhancement via JavaScript if available. Using the optional bit of JS the site can automatically prefetch other pages while you read, making page transitions near-instantaneous. The site is generated using [`react-static`](https://github.com/nozzle/react-static), which (despite initial difficulties) has proven to be quite a productive tool for these sort of things. Views are written as normal [React](https://reactjs.org/) components and rendered into static HTML by the generator. Blog posts are written in Markdown, and rendered into HTML with [`marked`](https://github.com/markedjs/marked). When running the site in development mode everything from stylesheets to blog post metadata is hotloaded within a second when source files change, which provides quite a nice development / blog post authoring experience. Image previews are resized and compressed from high resolution images using a small script I wrote which utilises [`jimp`](https://github.com/oliver-moran/jimp).
